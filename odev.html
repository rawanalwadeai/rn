    <h1>ABOUT ME AND MY COUNTRY</h1>
    <font size="5">
        <p>
            This is my first website and I would like to talk about myself and my country.<br />
            At first, I'm Rawan.I live in <b>Turkey</b>. My major is software engineering at gelisim university.
        <br /><br />

            <br />
            My country is <b>Yemen</b>. The Republic of Yemen is an Arab country occupying the southwestern to southern<br />
            end of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf<br />
            of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east.Also in Yemen there is one of the most beautiful <br />
            islands. Sokotra, island in the Indian Ocean about 210 miles (340 km) southeast of Yemen, to which it belongs.<br />
            The largest of several islands extending eastward from the Horn of Africa, it has an area of about 1,400 <br />
            square miles (3,600 square km). The Hajīr (Hajhir) Mountains occupy Socotra’s interior, with narrow coastal<br />
            plains in the north and a broader plain in the south.To the southwest and west are the smaller islands of<br />
            Samḥah and Darzah, called al-Ikhwān (“the Brothers”), and ʿAbd al-Kūrī, all of which also belong to Yemen. <br />
            The islands stand on coral banks and may once have been connected with the African and Arabian mainlands.Socotra’s<br />
            flora includes several famous species, among them myrrh, frankincense, and the dragon’s blood tree.In recognition<br />
            of its distinct plant and animal life, the archipelago was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008.<br /><br />
